🔴 3 CRITICAL Issues (Blocking Features)
Missing /api/clients route - Client management completely broken (404s)
Missing /api/returns route - GST returns preparation/generation broken
Missing /api/firebaselogin route - Firebase authentication broken
All three routes exist in your backend but are NOT registered in server.js!

🟠 3 HIGH Priority Issues
Auth endpoints using /auth/* instead of /api/auth/* (inconsistent)
Duplicate client stats endpoints in two different files
SECURITY RISK: Mocked authentication in invoice and GST routes that bypasses all security

🟡 4 MEDIUM Priority Issues
Hardcoded http://localhost:5000 in 15+ components (blocks production deployment)
Dashboard Context doesn't handle partial failures gracefully
Inconsistent client filtering (some use clientId, others businessId)
GST download uses relative path without base URL
🟢 3 LOW Priority Issues
11-13. Code quality improvements (magic numbers, duplicate helpers, etc.)

Most urgent: Your server.js is missing 3 critical route registrations. This is why client management, GST returns, and Firebase login aren't working! 🚨
