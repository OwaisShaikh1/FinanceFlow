### How Data Isolation Works

#### 1. **Business Assignment**
Each business has two key references:
- `owner`: The client who owns the business
- `assignedCA`: The CA managing the business

```javascript
{
  name: "Amit's Retail Business",
  owner: ObjectId("client_amit"),      // Client can see ONLY their business
  assignedCA: ObjectId("ca_rajesh"),   // CA can see ALL assigned businesses
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### 2. **Transaction Isolation**
Every transaction links to specific user AND business:
```javascript
{
  user: ObjectId("client_amit"),
  business: ObjectId("amit_business"),
  amount: 50000,
  type: "income",
  // ... Client can ONLY see their own transactions
}
```

#### 3. **Query Filtering**
When fetching data:

**For Clients:**
```javascript
// Clients see ONLY their business data
const transactions = await Transaction.find({ 
  user: currentUser._id,
  business: currentUser.business 
});
```

**For CAs:**
```javascript
// CAs see ALL their assigned businesses
const businesses = await Business.find({ 
  assignedCA: caUser._id 
});

const allClientTransactions = await Transaction.find({ 
  business: { $in: businessIds } 
});
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### 1. User-Level Isolation
```javascript
// Middleware ensures users only see their data
router.get('/transactions', auth, async (req, res) => {
  const query = { user: req.user._id };  // Auto-filtered by user
  if (req.user.role !== 'ca') {
    query.business = req.user.business;  // Non-CAs: only their business
  }
  const transactions = await Transaction.find(query);
});
```

### 2. Business-Level Isolation
- Each transaction/invoice/TDS record has `business` reference
- Queries automatically filter by business ownership
- No client can see another client's data

### 3. CA Access Control
- CAs can access businesses where `assignedCA === caUser._id`
- CAs see aggregated data across all clients
- CAs cannot modify client business ownership
