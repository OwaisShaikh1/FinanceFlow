## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration Script Fails
**Solution:**
1. Check MongoDB connection string in `.env`
2. Ensure database is accessible
3. Check for sufficient permissions
4. Review error messages in console

### Issue: Duplicate Key Errors
**Solution:**
1. This might happen with unique indexes
2. Check for duplicate data in your database
3. Clean up duplicates before running migration
4. Contact support if issue persists

### Issue: Missing User References
**Solution:**
The migration script automatically:
1. Finds business owner
2. Assigns to transactions/invoices
3. Creates default references
4. Logs all updates

### Issue: Chart of Accounts Not Created
**Solution:**
1. Run `create-chart-of-accounts.js` separately
2. Check if business has owner assigned
3. Verify business exists in database
4. Check console for specific errors
